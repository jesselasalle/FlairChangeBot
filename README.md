# FlairChangeBot
FlairChangeBot for reddit

Use praw.ini to set your authentication details
Use config.py to set your variables:
  - subreddit: The subreddit where your account will have flair moderator permissions
  - flair_text_to_change: The text of the flair you want to remove
  - flair_text_to_set:    The text of the flair you want to set.
  
The bot will output the number of results over time. Please note that Reddit's indexing can be incredibly slow, leading to inaccurate reporting in your console.

There's nothing I can do about this. This will not cause harm.
